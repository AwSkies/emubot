### About This Repository
This repository is the code for the Emu Bot Discord bot  
The Prototypes folder is for drafting new commands/concepts in a safe and clutter-free environment.  
The Examples/Tests folder is for files that give an example for how to do something/I used to test probably using the dummy bot  
The Pictures folder is for the picture commands (it will upload them)  
To any would-be hijackers who have found the token deep within the history of this repository, it won't work. If you truly know how this works, you should've figured out by now that that token is very old and was changed and hidden away where you'll never find it.

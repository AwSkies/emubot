Code for the Emu Bot Discord bot

The Prototypes folder is for drafting new commands/concepts in a safe and clutter-free environment.

The Examples/Tests folder is for files that give an example for how to do something/I used to test probably using the dummy bot

The Pictures folder is for the picture commands (it will upload them)

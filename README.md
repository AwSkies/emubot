# async-0.16.12
## About this branch
This branch is a preservation of the old Emu Bot code.  
This branch *is not* the current or up-to-date code that is currently running the Emu Bot. 
The code you see here runs on the async version of discord.py, version 0.16.12, hence the name of the brannch.  
This branch *will not* be updated or had any more commits made on it.
